        <div class="subheading mb-5">Bilingual Teacherüë©‚Äçüè´</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current undergraduate student at University of California Riverside majoring in Education and minoring in Spanish. I am a first generation student and started my educational journey at a community college and worked my way to a four year university. While at MiraCosta College I learned the importance of staying involved and making connections which has helped me accomplish a lot in my journey thus far. As an undergrad I have been heavily involved on campus by co-founding the Puente Connection organization, which focuses on helping transfer students adjust to the quarter system. I also became a peer educator for incoming transfer students, I was able to provide a workshop to provide resources and mentorship.<br><br>
        I have also worked with the undergraduate admissions office for over two years. Here I have gained experience advising community college students on the admissions requirements to UCR. I also had the opportunity to promote my university at college fairs. I obtained knowledge on evaluating transcripts to further advise students on meeting requirements. I was also able to share my transfer experience with prospective students while helping on campus events such as open houses. I focus on helping cohorts of students who belong to the Puente Project and affiliates.  Lastly, I was able to be part of the logistics team for the UCR Puente Leadership and Writers conferences in the summer. Currently, I am also working with a non profit organization called BLU Educational Foundation. This organization works with high school seniors who are not considered ‚Äúcollege bound‚Äù to get them into at least one college or university. I am part of the college advisors who helps these students apply for financial aid, college applications and the retention of these students once they are in college. We focus specifically on African American and Latinx students who are first generation. We also work with the parents of these students to inform them of what their children are doing and how they can support their students in this new stage of their educational journey.<br><br>

        During my last year as an undergraduate I had the great opportunity to study abroad for four months in the city of Bologna Italy where I was able to further my language skills. This experience has been by far the most impactful in my personal and professional development. I had the chance to have an internship with PACE in English, where I was a teacher‚Äôs assistant. We provided English courses for kids as young as 1 year old to 8 year olds. However, this experience was very unique because our teaching method was through music and art. It was amazing to see how these young italian children were able to learn so much vocabulary from these fun and entertaining activities. These months far away from my country opened my mind to a lot of different cultures and ideas. I was also able to travel to other countries such as Germany, Spain, France and Croatia. I believe this opportunity allowed me to meet so many people from diverse backgrounds which exposed me to greater knowledge.
